This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to type inference and function overloading in Hack.  The `foo` and `bar` functions appear to work correctly, however, a deeper inspection shows that the type system might not always behave as expected, particularly in scenarios with complex type interactions. The bug is not immediately apparent, highlighting a potential pitfall when using Hack's type inference system.  The solution explores ways to improve type safety and prevent such unexpected behavior.
